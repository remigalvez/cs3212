# CSCI 3212 - Algorithms

## Test environment

* Navigate to directory to test
* Compile all java files using "javac *.java"
* Run "java -jar \<path to algtest.jar\> \<path to .props file\>"

## Directory organization

The assignment instructions files are in each assignment folder, generally named Exercise \*.html, or Assignment \*.html.
Directories with remigalvez16 followed by a number are homework exercises, and those followed by _a\* are assignments (larger). Each directory contains .java files, a .props file for testing, a subdirectory with the same name, and a .jar file with the same name.
