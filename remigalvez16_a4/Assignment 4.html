In this problem, you will solve a security problem: placing cameras
in an indoor space that needs to be surveilled. The idea is to 
use as few cameras as possible to <i>cover</i> a given indoor space.
The indoor space could be a little complicated, with interior walls,
and might require both judicious placement of each camera and its
orientation (where it points).
To simplify the
problem, we will use a simple 2D floorplan and give you all the
support code needed for placing the cameras and seeing the
results. <em>All you have to do is provide coordinates and
orientation for each camera </em>. You can use as many cameras
as you need, but your solution will be judged on <i>how few</i>
cameras you use to cover the given space.

<P> Let's start with an example indoor floorplan:
  <center>
  <p><img src="fig1.png" height="400" width="600">
  </center>
Here, there are four exterior walls and one interior wall, all shown
as grey cells. The interior space is all white and consists of 
square white tiles.

<p>
We'll now place a single camera at the bottom left corner of the
interior space:
  <center>
  <p><img src="fig2.png" height="300" width="480">
  </center>
What we see are:
  <ul>
  <li> A camera placed at location <i>(1,1)</i> with orientation = 45 degrees.
  <li> The orientation (where the center of the camera is pointing) is shown by the blue line.
  <li> The camera has a range: in this case, 30 degrees on either side
   of its orientation. The green lines show the range.
  <li> The red tiles are the ones that are covered by this camera, and
   the white tiles are <i>uncovered</i> tiles. The rule is:
   <i>all four corners of a tile must be entirely within the
    range of a camera, with no walls blocking its sight, for
    the tile to be considered covered by that camera</i>.
  </ul>

<p> Let's add a camera at location <i>(maxX-1, maxY-1)</i>, which is
the top right corner of the interior area.
  <center>
  <p><img src="fig3.png" height="300" width="480">
  </center>
What we see is that we get more coverage, but the whole area is still
not covered.

<p>The goal of the problem should now be clear: <i>place as few
cameras as possible, along with their orientations, 
to cover all the white tiles</i>. What
you are given is: 
  <ul>
  <li> The locations of the interior walls. (The exterior walls are
   the same four walls.)
  <li> Each camera's range.
  </ul>
You can use as many cameras as you need, but the goal of course is to use
as few as possible. A tile may be covered by multiple cameras.

<p> To get started:
<ul>
<li> Download <b><a href="camera.jar">camera.jar</a></b> and unpack.
<li> To compile and execute: compile and execute the file 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>CameraPlacementTest.java</tt></font>,
     which has 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>main()</tt></font>.
<li> You will need to write your code in a file <i>which has your
username embedded in the name</i>. For example, 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>BeavisAlgorithm.java</tt></font>.
<li> There are two sample algorithms provided in 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>DummyAlgorithm.java</tt></font>
   and
      <font color="#000000"><tt>IterativeDummyAlgorithm.java</tt></font>.
  So, to get started, you can simply copy over the code in 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>DummyAlgorithm.java</tt></font>
  to your file as a starting point.
<li> Next, examine the file
      <font color="#000000"><tt>CameraPlacementTest.java</tt></font>.
  <ul>
  <li> In the 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>main()</tt></font>.
      method, you will see a couple of methods, only one of which
      is not commented out. All of these are examples of
      ways you can run the support code.
  <li> If you run 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>demo1()</tt></font>,
      you will see three windows (frames). One will have the 
      problem (the floorplan), one will show coverage but
      without showing the cameras, and the third will show
      both coverage and cameras. The commandline also outputs
      which tiles get covered and what percent is uncovered.
  <li> In 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>demo1()</tt></font>,
      try out 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>("small", 0)</tt></font>,
      <font color="#000000"><tt>("small", 1)</tt></font>,
      and 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>("small", 2)</tt></font>.
      The number that's the second argument produces
      a particular problem instance.
      You can replace 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>"small"</tt></font>
      with 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>"big"</tt></font>
      to see a second suite of problems (with problem #0, 1, 2).
  <Li> Next, in 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>demo1()</tt></font>,
    examine, the code
    <pre><font color="#000000">
	CameraPlacementAlgorithm alg = new DummyAlgorithm ();
	CameraPlacementResult result = CameraPlacement.runAlgorithm (alg, problem, false, false);
	System.out.println (result);
    </font></pre>
    This is basically how the test-environment for the camera
    placement works. You create an instance of an algorithm.
    Then you run the algorithm with a particular problem.
    The last two parameters are boolean: whether or not
    to display, and whether or not to show the cameras in the display.
  <li> The second demo is probably what you'll use most often
    in initially testing your algorithm. Let's examine the code:
    <pre><font color="#000000">
	int problemNum = 1;
	CameraPlacementProblem problem = CameraProblemFactory.getProblem ("small", problemNum);
	CameraPlacementAlgorithm alg = new IterativeDummyAlgorithm ();
	CameraPlacementResult result = CameraPlacement.runAlgorithm (alg, problem, true, true);
    </font></pre>
  The class
      <font color="#000000"><tt>CameraProblemFactory</tt></font>,
  is what contains various problem instances. 
  Here, we are asking the problem factory to give us problem #1 
  of the "small" type. Then we create an instance of an algorithm
  and run it, showing both the GUI with the camera locations. Try it.
  </ul>
<li> Obviously, the code examples above, you will replace
      <font color="#000000"><tt>DummyAlgorithm</tt></font>
   and
      <font color="#000000"><tt>IterativeDummyAlgorithm</tt></font>
   with your algorithm.
</ul>

<p> OK, now that you know how to run your algorithm, let's see
what's involved in writing an algorithm. We'll examine the two
default algorithms:
<ul>
<li> The goal of any algorithm is to return a <i>list</i> of
cameras that you create. In this case, it needs to be an
      <font color="#000000"><tt>ArrayList&lt;Camera&gt;</tt></font>,
as shown in the code.
<li> Next, let's examine the first camera created in this "dumb"
algorithm:
    <pre><font color="#000000">
	Camera camera = new Camera( new Pointd(1,1),  45, true );
	cameraList.add(camera);
    </font></pre>
Here, we are creating a camera located at grid point <i>(1,1)</i> with an
orientation of 45 degrees, and we specify that we want to see
the camera when cameras are displayed. Note: later, when
you use lots of cameras, then showing all of them could
potentially be confusing (with lots of lines on the screen); so,
you can selectively decide not to show some cameras.
<li> This "dumb" algorithm merely places four cameras at the four
corners of the indoor space.
<li> Your algorithm will, of course, use the wall information to 
cleverly place cameras <i>algorithmically</i> instead of hard-coding
particular locations.
<li> One step towards algorithmic placement is shown in the
second of the two algorithms, which iteratively places
cameras along the four walls. Reading through the code
will help you understand how it works. Notice how the
cameras use different orientations. Then, display the result
for small-problems #1 and #2.
<li> The most important thing to note about the second algorithm is
how it evaluates the coverage as it proceeds:
    <pre><font color="#000000">
    result = CameraPlacement.evaluatePlacement (problem, cameraList);
    </font></pre>
This takes in the current camera-list and asks the test environment
to evaluate the coverage. Examine the file 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>CameraPlacementResult</tt></font>.
You can get the number of tiles covered, the number not covered,
and so on. But most importantly, for each tile you can get this
info in the 2D array 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>cover</tt></font>.
For example, 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>cover[3][4]</tt></font>
will be 0 (if not covered), 1 (if covered) and -1 (if the tile is
in a wall). 
<li> A tile's coordinates are specified by the tile's lower left corner.
</ul>

<p> How do you know where the interior walls are going to be? You
can get this information from the problem instance that's
given to your 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>solve()</tt></font>,
method, where you will write most of your code. You can extract
from a problem all the relevant data you need for your algorithm
including: 
      <font color="#000000"><tt>maxX, maxY</tt></font>,
the interior walls, the range of each camera.
<ul>
<li> Each wall is represented by two sets of coordinates.
<li> A horizontal wall is represented by the line on the lower
 side of the wall.
<li> A vertical wall is represented by the line on the left
  side of the wall. In the example above, there is only
  one interior wall, which is vertical in this case.
  This wall is represented by coordinates <i>(8,1)</i>
  and <i>(8,7)</i>, which are actually the end points 
  of the line that's the left edge of the wall.
  There's no particular reason for this choice: we had
  to make some choice, and this is what we chose. We could
  have used the right edge just as easily.
<li> All wall coordinates use integer locations.
</ul>

<p> About the cameras:
<ul>
<li> A camera's location should use integer coordinates, even
though the
      <font color="#000000"><tt>Pointd</tt></font>,
class uses double's. (We need the double's for doing the 
intersection calculations.)
<li> Similarly, the orientation needs to be an integer between 
<i>0</i> and <i>359</i> inclusive.
<li> If you place a camera in an improper location (such as:
not on a wall, outside the floorplan etc), the test code will
flag an error.
<li> If your camera's orientation is improper (for example: facing
into a wall), this is not an error but the camera will be useless
in providing coverage.
</ul>

<p> Note: you are welcome to examine all the other code, but
you really don't need to know much more than is described above.

<p> Other points to note:
<ul>
<li> All cameras will have the same range.
<li> No wall will completely partition the space. That is, it will be
possible to walk from anywhere to anywhere inside the space.
<li> There might be isolated walls that don't touch any other walls.
<li> You cannot place multiple cameras in the same spot.
<li> Cameras can only be placed on walls (not on the floor).

</ul>


<p> The <b>competition</b>:
<ul>
<li> We will run each student's algorithm on the problems currently
included, and on a few additional problems we will create.
<li> We will examine both coverage and number of cameras, as
well as the ratio of the number of cameras to covered tiles (this
ratio needs to be as small as possible).
<li> Algorithms will be ranked in each of the three categories.
<li> Some points will be awarded for placing well in the competition.
</ul>


<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Submission: </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<li> Name your file as described above (with your name as part of the
file name).
<li> IMPORTANT: write all your code in that one file. You can
of course use multiple methods, and create your own classes, but
please put all the code in one file. The reason is, we will have
all student code in one directory: it will be convenient with fewer files.
<li> You'll need to follow
the usual <a href="../../submit/submit.html">submission instructions</a>
carefully.
<li> 
The name of subdirectory should be: your username
followed by <font color="#000000"><tt>_a4</tt></font>. 
<br>
Example: if your username is <font color="#000000"><tt>beavis</tt></font>
your subdirectory will be called 
<font color="#000000"><tt>beavis_a4</tt></font>.
<br> Thus, the jar file will be called 
<font color="#000000"><tt>beavis_a4.jar</tt></font>.
<li> As usual, if you create your own classes for this assignment,
you should give them unique names (prefixed by your username).
