<p><li> Read through <a
href="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~simhaweb/java/lectures/appendix/stepwise.html">an
example</a> of how to go from a high-level idea to an actual 
implementation.

<p><li> Pen-and-paper exercises:
  <ol type="A">
  <li> Among the following functions, for each distinct pair
  <i>f<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>f<sub>j</sub></i>, 
  identify the "order" relationship: 
  is  <i>f<sub>i</sub> = O(f<sub>j</sub>)</i>, 
  <i>f<sub>i</sub> = &Omega;(f<sub>j</sub>)</i>, 
  or <i>f<sub>i</sub> = &Theta;(f<sub>j</sub>)</i>?
  The functions are:
   <br><i>f<sub>1</sub>(n) = n</i>,
   <br><i>f<sub>2</sub>(n) = n log(n)</i>,
   <br><i>f<sub>3</sub>(n) = n log(n<sup>2</sup>)</i>,
   <br><i>f<sub>4</sub>(n) = n<sup>2.5</sup></i>,
   <br><i>f<sub>5</sub>(n) = n sqrt(n)</i>,
   <br><i>f<sub>6</sub>(n) = n<sup>2</sup>log(n)</i>.
  <!--
  <li> Show that the <i>f(n) = e<sup>n</sup></i> is <i>O(3<sup>n</sup>)</i>
   by finding the <i>c</i> and <i>N</i> to satisfy the definition.
  -->
  <li> Find the appropriate "order" relationship between 
   <i>n log(n)</i> and <i>10n</i> and find the constants
   <i>c</i> and <i>N</i>.
  <li> Analyze the following code and provide a "Big-Oh" estimate of
  its running time. Explain your analysis.
  <pre><font color="#000000">
    for (int i=0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j=0; j < n*n; j++)
        sum += data[i] * data[j];
      for (int j=0; j < 4*n; j++)
        sum += data[i] + data[j];
    }
  </font></pre>
<p><li> <b>Duplicate removal, part I</b>. 
In this problem, we are given an array of positive (nonzero)
integers with possible
duplicates, such as: 
  <tt><font color="#000000">[2,3,2,2,1]</font></tt>. The general goal
is to return a new array with all the duplicates removed, as in:
  <tt><font color="#000000">[2,1,3]</font></tt>. 
We'll consider a variation in which we return the original
array reorganized so that all the unique elements are 
found from the first element onwards until the last unique element,
as in: 
  <tt><font color="#000000">[2,1,3,_,_]</font></tt>. 
Here, we also compute the new length 
  <tt><font color="#000000">n=3</font></tt>,
which is the number of non-duplicate elements.
The reorganized array need not have 
the elements in the same order as in the original. Now consider
the following attempt, written in pseudocode. (Assume array indices
start at 1, and the array 
  <tt><font color="#000000">A</font></tt>. 
is available globally to all the methods):
<font color="#000000"><pre>
    <b>Algorithm</b>: removeDuplicates
        <b>for</b> i=1 <b>to</b> n 
            <b>if</b> isDuplicate (i)
                remove (i)
            <b>endif</b>
        <b>endfor</b>
    <b>return</b> n

    <b>Method</b>: isDuplicate (i)
        <b>for</b> i=1 <b>to</b> n
            <b>if</b> A[j] = A[i]
                <b>return</b> true
            <b>endif</b>
        <b>endfor</b>
        <b>return</b> false

    <b>Method</b>: remove (i)
    // Removes and performs a left-shift.
        <b>for</b> j=n-1 <b>to</b> i
            A[j] = A[j+1]
        <b>endfor</b>
        n = n -1
     </pre></font>

  <ul>
  <li> If the algorithm were to work, how long does it take to run,
  expressed in order-notation? Explain your answer.
  <li> There are actually some algorithmic errors (we won't worry
    about syntax). Can you find them? How would 
  you fix them? Submit corrected <i>pseudocode</i>, written in the
  same style. 
  </ul>
  </ol>
<b>Note:</b> Credit will not be given only for answers - show all your
work: your reasoning, steps you took to get your answer etc.

<p><li> Implement the Insertion Sort method (see the Wikipedia entry)
and compare it to the SelectionSort technique in
Module 1. To implement, you will need to follow these steps:
  <ul>
  <li> First: (1) create a separate directory for the course called <tt><font color="#000000">cs3212</font></tt>; 
  (2) create a directory called <tt><font color="#000000">submit</font></tt> off of your home directory.
  <li> Follow the <a href="../../submit/submit.html">submission instructions</a>
  to download the algorithm test environment.
  <li> Create a subdirectory called <tt><font color="#000000">yourusername1</font></tt> (for
  example, if your username is <tt><font color="#000000">beavis</font></tt>, create subdirectory
  off of <tt><font color="#000000">cs3212</font></tt> called <tt><font color="#000000">beavis1</font></tt> to indicate exercise 1).
  You will implement AND execute your insertion sort code in this directory.
  <li> Next, download the following two text files: <a
  href="ex1.props">ex1.props</a>
  and <a href="ex1.props2">ex1.props2</a>.
  <li> Write your code in files called <tt><font color="#000000">InsertionSort.java</font></tt> and <tt><font color="#000000">SelectionSort.java</font></tt>.
  <li> Both of these need to implement the <a href="SortingAlgorithm.html">SortingAlgorithm</a>
  interface. Note that you will also need to implement the
  <a href="Algorithm.html">Algorithm</a> interface because
  <tt><font color="#000000">SortingAlgorithm</font></tt> extends <tt><font color="#000000">Algorithm</font></tt>.
  <li> In implementing the <tt><font color="#000000">Algorithm</font></tt> interface, only provide
  an empty implementation for <tt><font color="#000000">setPropertyExtractor</font></tt>. 
  <li> You will only need to write code for the <tt><font color="#000000">sortInPlace
  (int[])</font></tt> method in the <tt><font color="#000000">SortingAlgorithm</font></tt> interface. 
   However, you will need to provide at least empty
  implementations (method definition, but empty body) 
  for the other methods. We will not test the other methods.
  <li> Once you have written the code <em>for both algorithms</em>
  and want to test: get into the
  <tt><font color="#000000">yourusername1</font></tt> directory and simply type the following (for Unix):
    <pre><font color="#000000">
      % java -jar ../algtest.jar ex1.props
    </font></pre>
  (You can run something similar with a DOS-prompt).
  The jar file contains an algorithm test environment which will run
  your program and perform some tests.
  <li> If you like you may run a test with the second properties file,
  <tt><font color="#000000">ex1.props2</font></tt>. For this purpose you will have to be at a
  machine that can display a Java GUI (so, you can't run it on <tt><font color="#000000">hobbes</font></tt>).
  </ul>

<p><li> Write code that takes as input an array of integers and
rearranges the array to have the following property:
  <ul>
  <li> Suppose the first element in the original array has the value <i>x</i>.
  <li> In the new array, suppose that <i>x</i> is in position
  <i>i</i>, that is <tt><font color="#000000">data[i] = x</font></tt>.
  Then, <tt><font color="#000000">data[j] <= x</font></tt> for all <tt><font color="#000000">j < i</font></tt> and
  <tt><font color="#000000">data[j] > x</font></tt> for all <tt><font color="#000000">j > i</font></tt>.
  Thus, informally, all the values to the "left" of <i>x</i>
  are less than (or equal to) <i>x</i> and all values to the right
  are larger than <i>x</i>.
  <li> Here's an example. Suppose the array has the elements in this
   initial order: 4,3,9,2,7,6,5. After one possible (there are many)
   partition, we get: 3,2,4,5,9,7,6. That is, the leftmost element, 4,
   is positioned in the resulting array so that all elements less than
   4 (that is, 2, 3) are to its left (in no particular order), and all
   elements larger than 4 are to its right (again, in no particular order).
  </ul>
Write your code in a file called <tt><font color="#000000">MyPartition.java</font></tt>:
  <ul>
  <li> Make your class it implement the <a
href="PartitionAlgorithm.html">PartitionAlgorithm</a> interface.
  <li> You will only need to write code for the
  <tt><font color="#000000">leftIncreasingPartition</font></tt> method. Provide an empty
  implementation for the other - we will not test it.
  Note: your partitioning code will be in this method.
  <li> Observe that you are given a sub-range within the array
  which you will re-arrange. Do NOT touch elements outside
  the subrange.
  <li> Use the <a href="ex1.props3">ex1.props3</a> properties file for
    this problem.
  </ul>

</ol>


<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Note: </FONT></B></P>
 <ul>
 <li> What is an empty implementation of a method? For a void-returning method,
  it means you write out the 
  method definition (with parameters) and curly braces, 
  but don't add any code in between
  the braces. For a method that needs to return something, you can
  return some default value. The purpose is just to let the result compile.
 <li> Unless otherwise specified we will assume that all sorting
 algorithms in this course will sort in increasing order (smallest element first).
 <li> For each of your algorithms, write a <tt><font color="#000000">main</font></tt>
 method in which you perform some testing independent of the
 environment we provide you. You will be graded on the testing
 you perform.
 <li> The algorithm testing environment only helps with
 <em>testing</em> - it does NOT help with <em>debugging</em>, 
 which you are expected to do on your own. In this regard,
 the test-environment may indicate that your code has failed
 a test, but will not provide additional detail (this is what
 we mean by "helps with testing, but not debugging").
 <li> For this assignment and others, we expect you to write
 clean, documented code following the guidelines mentioned on the
 homepage.
 </ul>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Submission: </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<li> Do NOT submit hardcopy of your code. Only submit the
pen-and-paper part in my mailbox, or hand it over to the TA
during office hours before the deadline.
Note: unfortunately, there is no drop-off box in the SEH.

<li> For this assignment and others, you will need to follow
<a href="../../submit/submit.html">submission instructions</a>
carefully.
We have created a submission tool that picks up encoded
jar files from students, decodes, compiles and executes.
To have this work correctly, it is essential that you 
follow the instructions correctly.
