<p><li> PART I: Pen-and-paper exercises:
  <ol type="A">
  <!--
  <li> Consider the graph below:
    <p><img src="fig2.gif"><p>
  Each edge has a weight that represents the probability of
  being "alive". Consider the path ABEG. The probability of 
  the path ABEG being viable is the probability that all
  the edges in the path are "alive".
  This is the product of the probabilities associated
  with those edges. Thus, the probability that
  the path ABEG is viable is <i>0.4 * 0.7 * 0.8 =
  0.22</i>. We might term this the "viability" of the
  path ABEG. We are interested in the "most viable" path between
  every pair of nodes. 
   <ul>
   <li> In general, the input is a weighted graph with a weight
   <i>p<sub>e</sub></i> for each edge <i>e</i> where 
   <i>p<sub>e</sub></i> represents the probability the edge
   is "alive" or "functioning".
   <li> Describe an algorithm for finding the "most viable" path.
   <br>Hint: Consider <i>log(p<sub>e</sub>)</i> for each edge <i>e</i>
   and use the fact that <i>log (x y) = log(x) + log(y)</i>.
   <li> Show how your algorithm finds the "most viable" path
   from A to G step by step with the example above.
   </ul>

  <!--
  <li> Remember the wildcard search problem from Module 5? Here's your chance to work on your pseudocode skills. Write pseudocode for in-class exercise 5.7, the wildcard matching problem.
  -->
  <li><b>Transaction problem, part 4</b>.
  In this variation, there are multiple transactions allowed but
  no two transactions are allowed to overlap. That
  is, given any two transactions A and B, if the buy date for
  transaction A precedes the buy date for transaction B then
  the sell date for transaction A must precede the <i>buy</i> date
  (and hence the sell date too) of transaction B. Thus, one is
  allowed to "hold" only one transaction at a time. 
    <ol type="i">
    <li> For the example price array given by
       <tt><font color="#000000">[10,13,15,11,14]</font></tt>        
    what is the solution to the problem?
    <li> Show how dynamic programming can be used to solve this
    problem. That is, try to write the dynamic programming recurrence.
    Start by defining <i>D(i,j,k)</i> to be the optimal profit
    obtained when at most <i>k</i> non-overlapping transactions are used
    between days <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> inclusive. Then try to set
    up a dynamic programming equation.

<b>Note:</b> Credit will not be given only for answers - show all your
work: your reasoning, steps you took to get your answer etc.

<p><li> PART II: Implementation:
In this part, you will implement three, possibly four, algorithms for a
variation of of the <em>traveling salesman problem</em>.
In this variation, there are <i>m</i> salesmen who can
work in parallel. The goal is to subdivide the points,
and find a good tour for each salesman. The objective is
to minimize the length of the worst tour among the salesmen.

<p>Let's first formally define the problem:
 <ul>
 <li> The input is a number <i>m</i> (the number of salesmen)
   and a collection of points on the 2D plane, that is,
   a collection of <i>n</i> (x,y) pairs.
 <li> As a first step, take a look at how the input is
    given to your algorithm. Your algorithm must implement
    the <a href="MTSPAlgorithm.html">MTSPAlgorithm</a>
    interface. The input, thus, is the number <i>m</i> and
    an array of points, where each point is an instance
    of the class <a href="Pointd.html">Pointd</a>.
  <li> Now consider what an algorithm must return as output.
     Since each salesman is assigned a subset of points,
     the algorithm must return the collection of points
     assigned to each particular salesman. You are
     required to return a 2D array such that row <i>i</i>
     of the 2D array consists of the points assigned to 
     salesman <i>i</i>.
 <li> Suppose the input has 20 points and 3 salesmen. You might
   choose to assign the first one 10 points, the second one 7
   points and the third one 3 points. If you put these
   points into a 2D array, and suppose that array is
   called <font color="#000000"><tt>assignedPoints</tt></font>. Then,
   <font color="#000000"><tt>assignedPoints[0]</tt></font> is of type <font color="#000000"><tt>Pointd[]</tt></font>
   and <font color="#000000"><tt>assignedPoints[0].length == 10</tt></font>. Similarly,
   <font color="#000000"><tt>assignedPoints[1].length == 7</tt></font>
   and <font color="#000000"><tt>assignedPoints[2].length == 3</tt></font>. Thus,
   <font color="#000000"><tt>assignedPoints</tt></font> is an uneven, staggered array.
 <li> It is always the case that <font color="#000000"><tt>assignedPoints.length == m</tt></font>.
 <li> Next, for each row of the 2D array, the numbers in that
  row are to represent the tour order for that row.
  Thus, if <font color="#000000"><tt>assignedPoints[1]</tt></font> is the array <font color="#000000"><tt>{4, 12, 9, 6, 18, 3, 5}</tt></font>
  then, this means that salesman 1 (the second salesman)
  was assigned points <i>4, 12, 9, 6, 18, 3, 5</i> and that the
  tour for this salesman is the order given by <i>4, 12, 9, 6, 18, 3, 5</i>.
 <li> Note that each tour has unique indices (that is, no point is
   repeated, including the end).
 <li> You might wonder if it's possible to assign no points to
  some salesmen (if that helps). Yes, indeed, you can. You can
  assign any number of points to any salesman. To assign zero
  points, make the row pointer null.
 <li> Clearly, there is some optimal assignment of points to 
   salesmen, and after assignment, some optimal tour for each
   salesman (among the points assigned to that salesman).
   Your goal is not to find the absolute optimum, but to
   try and find "good" assignments and tours.
 </ul> 

<p> You will implement these three algorithms:
  <ul>
  <li> A "naive" algorithm in <font color="#000000"><tt>Naive.java</tt></font> that merely 
    divides the points more or less evenly among the salesmen
    ("more or less" because <i>m</i> may not exactly divide
    the number of points).
  <li> A "greedy" algorithm in <font color="#000000"><tt>Greedy.java</tt></font>
  that will execute in polynomial time.
  <br>Note: implement a "greedy" algorithm (that builds a solution
  step by step) as opposed to a "greedy-local-search" algorithm
  (that explores the state space).
  <li> Simulated annealing, in <font color="#000000"><tt>Annealing.java</tt></font>
  </ul>

<p><b>[Bonus points].</b> You can optionally implement a fourth algorithm
for extra points that will be applied to a previous low-scoring
assignment or exercise.
This would an algorithm that you design, with the objective of beating
the above three algorithms. Implement this in
a file called <font color="#000000"><tt>MyAlgorithm.java</tt></font>

<p>Implementation details:
  <ul>
  <li> All three (or four) classes will need to implement the 
   <a href="MTSPAlgorithm.html">MTSPAlgorithm</a> 
   interface.
  <li> The interface has only one method:
    <font color="#000000"><pre>
    int[][] computeTours (int m, Pointd[] points)
    </pre></font>
  <li> Use the <a href="mtsp.props">mtsp.props</a> properties
  file to run your algorithm in the test environment. 
  <li> Note that the test environment does not do much correctness-testing.
  The nature of optimization problems is that any dumb algorithm can produce
  a valid assignment - the value comes from the quality of the assignment.
  Thus, you need to submit evidence that your non-naive algorithms are
  doing "some good". Compare the quality of solution produced and time
  taken to produce the solutions for these algorithms.
  <li> Submit an example (on paper) to show that your greedy algorithm does
  not always produce the optimal solution.
  <li> Analyse the running time (in order-notation, on paper) of your greedy
  algorithm.
  <li> Using an example (on paper), 
  explain the neighborhood function used by your implementation
  of simulated annealing.
  <li> Submit documentation to explain how your own algorithm works.
   Use an illustrative example.
  <li> <b>Important:</b> You will need to download the latest version of 
the test environment.
  </ul>

<UL>
<li> Parts I and II are both due at the same time.
<li> For this assignment and others, you will need to follow
the usual <a href="../../submit/submit.html">submission instructions</a>
carefully.
<li> 
The name of subdirectory should be: your username
followed by <font color="#000000"><tt>_a3</tt></font>. 
<br>
Example: if your username is <font color="#000000"><tt>beavis</tt></font>
your subdirectory will be called 
<font color="#000000"><tt>beavis_a3</tt></font>.
<br> Thus, the jar file will be called 
<font color="#000000"><tt>beavis_a3.jar</tt></font>.
