<b>Note:</b> Credit will not be given only for answers - show all your
work: your reasoning, steps you took to get your answer etc.

<p><li> PART I: Implementation:
In this part, you will implement the naive algorithm for 
the <em>rectangle-set intersection problem</em>. In this
problem the input consists of two sets of rectangles.
The goal is to identify all pairs of rectangles that
intersect where the first rectangle in each pair is 
from the first set, and the other rectangle in the pair
is from the second set.

<p>Rectangles can be specified in many ways. We will use
the following convention: the top-left and bottom-right corners.
If you know these two points, then the two points uniquely
determine a rectangle.

<p> For example, consider these two sets of rectangles in the
region specified by (0,100) and (100,0):
  <ul>
  <li> Set1 = {R1, R2, R3} where
    <br> R1 = [ (5,80), (20,70) ]
    <br> R2 = [ (20,60), (40,50) ]
    <br> R3 = [ (20,30), (40,20) ]
  <li> Set2 = {R4, R5, R6, R7} where
    <br> R4 = [ (70,80), (80,70) ]
    <br> R5 = [ (30.55), (60.25) ]
    <br> R6 = [ (50,30), (65,20) ]
    <br> R7 = [ (70,30), (80,20) ]
  </ul>
You can see that R2 intersects R5, and R3 intersects R5.
These are the intersections to report: R2-R5 and R3-R5.
It so happens that R5 and R6 intersect, but since they
are from the same set, we don't report this intersection.

The naive algorithm works by examining each possible pair
of rectangles (one from each set) and determining whether the pair 
intersect, similar to the naive algorithm for
the largest-distance problem in Module 1.

<p>
Now, determining whether two rectangles intersect requires some
clarification:
  <ul>
  <li> To simplify the problem, we will use only integer coordinates.
  That is, the corners of rectangles, as well as the boundaries of
  the region will be specified with integer coordinates.
  <li> We will consider two rectangles as intersecting if they 
  have any point in commong, even
  a single point (a corner) in common.
  Thus, R1=[(1,5), (5,1)] and R2=[(5,10), (10,5)] intersect
  even though (5,5) is the only point they have in common.
  Similarly two rectangles are considered intersecting if any
  of their sides overlap a bit, one is inside the other or 
  exactly overlap. Thus, if you think of a rectangle as the
  set of points on its boundary and in its interior, then
  two rectangles intersect if their point-sets have a point (or
  more) in common.
  </ul>

<p>
To implement:
  <ul>
  <li> Write your code in a class called
  <tt><font color="#000000">NaiveRectIntersection.java</font></tt>. This class will need to implement
  the <a href="RectangleSetIntersectionAlgorithm.html">RectangleSetIntersectionAlgorithm</a>
  interface.
  <li> The classes/interfaces involved are: 
    <ul>
    <li> <a href="Algorithm.html">Algorithm</a>.
     The interface for all algorithms that use the test-environment.
    <li> <a href="RectangleSetIntersectionAlgorithm.html">
     RectangleSetIntersectionAlgorithm</a>.
     This is the interface for algorithms that solve the rectangle-set-intersection problem.
    <li> <a href="IntPoint.html">IntPoint</a>.
     A class that represents a point with x and y values
     (as <tt><font color="#000000">int's</font></tt>). 
    <li> <a href="IntRectangle.html">IntRectangle</a>.
     A class that represents a rectangle with integer coordinates.
    <li> <a href="IntPair.html">IntPair</a>. 
     A class that represents a pair of rectangle ID's
     (as <tt><font color="#000000">int's</font></tt>). 
    </ul>
   Note that <tt><font color="#000000">IntPoint, IntRectangle</font></tt>
   and <tt><font color="#000000">IntPair</font></tt>
   are already implemented for you; you will merely use these classes.
  <li> Note: each rectangle instance will have a unique ID. Thus, the
  input sets consist of two arrays of rectangles, each of which will
  have a unique ID. Suppose a rectangle with ID=5 is in the first set
  and that it intersects with a rectangle with ID=12 in the second
  set. Then, you will need to return the pair (5,12) as part of
  the return value of the method in 
  <tt><font color="#000000">RectangleSetIntersectionAlgorithm</font></tt>.
  How do you create the pair? Simply create an instance of 
  <tt><font color="#000000">IntPair</font></tt> as in:
   <pre><font color="#000000">
     IntPair ip = new IntPair (5, 12);
   </font></pre>
  Of course, you will be doing this in a loop and will be creating
  instances to add to the array that you will finally return
  in the method 
  <font color="#000000"><tt>findIntersections</tt></font>.
  <li> <b>Important</b>: if there are no intersections, you
  should return <font color="#000000"><tt>null</tt></font>.
  <li> You will need the following import statements in your classes:
   <pre><font color="#000000">
import edu.gwu.algtest.*;
import edu.gwu.util.*;
import edu.gwu.geometry.*;
import java.util.*;
   </font></pre>
  <Li> You may use the following <a href="a2.props">properties
  file</a> to test.
  </ul>

<p><li> PART I: Pseudocode: 
Read through part II below and provide pseudocode for your
algorithm(s). 
Since part II is not trivial, this will get you started with thinking
about part II.
Write your pseudocode neatly using the style in the modules.
Note: we will grade your pseudocode and compare it with
your actual code the following week. So, you really
need to think about your pseudocode carefully and
plan on using it for Part II.


<p><li> PART II Implementation:
In this part, you will implement an interesting tree-like structure
to reduce the number of rectangle-intersections computed.

<p> Here's how it would work:
  <ul>
  <li> The tree structure is called a <em>Rectangle Filter Tree</em>.
  <li> For starters, let us consider a data set consisting of a
  collection of rectangles and show how a data set of rectangles is
  inserted into a filter tree (just as a data set of strings might be
  inserted into a binary search tree). Later, we will show how to
  relate this structure to our original problem of finding
  intersections amongst rectangles in <em>two</em> data sets.
  <li> The general idea is to break up the region into imaginary sub-rectangles, 
  that are each then subdivided into imaginary (and smaller)
  sub-rectangles ... and so on. We take our input set of data
  rectangles and insert each rectangle one by one into the filter tree.
  The data rectangles are usually quite small and will get inserted 
  into the appropriate sub-rectangle in the tree. Hopefully, if the
  data rectangles are spread out, then they'll spread out over the
  tree, allowing for efficient search later on.
  <li> A picture will help us understand the details. Let's 
  consider inserting the following five data rectangles into
  a filter tree that spans the region defined by [(0,100), (100,0)]:
    <br> R1 = [(89,57), (91,37)]
    <br> R2 = [(12,80), (45,66)]
    <br> R3 = [(28,40), (39,29)]
    <br> R4 = [(18,70), (32,60)]
    <br> R5 = [(79,94), (82,90)]
  <p>Here are the rectangles depicted in the region [(0,100), (100,0)]:
    <p><img src="fig2.gif"><p>
  <li> First, we will look at what the filter tree looks like after
  all five data rectangles are inserted. Staring at this might be
  enough to understand how it works. We'll go through the steps next.
    <p><img src="fig3.gif"><p>
  <li> Here's an intuitive way to understand filter trees and to see
  why it's so named. The enclosing region [(0,100), (100,0)]
  represents the root node of the tree. Now the root node has
  horizontal and vertical <em>bisectors</em>. The horizontal
  bisector is the line that cuts the rectangle in half horizontally;
  the vertical bisector cuts the rectangle in half in the vertical direction.
  <br>Note that the bisectors together create four smaller
  sub-rectangles that we will call <em>quadrants</em>
  (squares, in this particular example). These four sub-rectangles 
  form the four nodes at the next level of the filter tree. 
  Each of these can be bisected horizontally and vertically to
  form 16 nodes at the third level of the tree ... and so on.
  <br> Now suppose we built a wire-frame grid for each rectangle at
  each level and "dropped" the data rectangles from above.
  Some data rectangles would fall through the top level (R2, R3, R4,
  R5), while others (R1) would get "trapped". The level at which 
  a data rectangle gets trapped determines the node in the tree
  where the data rectangle gets stored. Of course, we limit the
  number of levels so that eventually a data rectangle gets stored
  somewhere.
    <p><img src="perspect.gif"><p>
  <li> Now let's examine how the five data rectangles got inserted one
  by one.
    <ul>
    <li> In our example, we will build a 3-level tree (Filter trees
    can have arbitrary depth).
    <li> Initially, the root node is empty and there are no data
    rectangles:
    <p><img src="fig_init.gif"><p>
    <li> We will use this convention for numbering the quadrants:
    quadrant 0 is the Northeast quadrant, quadrant 1 is the Northwest
    quadrant ... and so on.
    <p><img src="fig_init2.gif"><p>
    <li> The first data rectangle (R1 = [(89,57), (91,37)]) is
    "dropped" into the current tree. It happens to get trapped at
    the root level and is stored in a linked list off of the root level.
    <p><img src="fig4.gif"><p>
    <li> The second data rectangle (R2 = [(12,80), (45,66)])
    is now dropped into the tree. It falls through the root into 
    quadrant 1. However, no node exists in the tree for quadrant 1,
    so we create it. R2 gets trapped by the bisectors of this
    sub-rectangle so it gets stored in the linked list off of this
    tree node.
    <p><img src="fig5.gif"><p>
    <li> The third data rectangle (R3 = [(28,40), (39,29)])
    is now dropped into the current tree. It falls through the root
    node, into quadrant 2, which needs to be created. Once it's
    created, R3 also falls through the second-level node into the
    third level, where it gets trapped:
    <p><img src="fig6.gif"><p>
    <li> The fourth data rectangle (R4 = [(18,70), (32,60)]) falls
    through the root and gets trapped at the next level in the 
    rectangle for quadrant 1 (of the root). This is where it gets stored:
    <p><img src="fig7.gif"><p>
    <li> The fifth data rectangle (R5 = [(79,94), (82,90)]) falls
    through the root (quadrant 0, which is created), then falls
    through quadrant 0 of the second level (which is created
    at the third level of the tree). It also falls through the
    third level, but since we are limiting the number of levels
    to three, we store the rectangle at this level.
    <p><img src="fig8.gif"><p>
    <li> The tree is now constructed. 
    <li> The most important observation to make is that each
    sub-rectangle in the tree is treated in the same way. 
    Thus,
    it is easy to write recursive code for insertion.
    <!--
    <li> See <a href="a2pseudo.html">Pseudocode</a>.
    -->
    </ul>

  <p><li> Next, consider how searching is done in the tree:
    <ul>
    <li> What does "search" really mean in this geometric-object
    context? 
     <br> => In search, the input is a "query" rectangle Q for which
     we need to find all the data rectangles that intersect with Q.
    <Li> Consider the example Q = [(20,64), (36,38)]. 
    Simply eyeballing the data tells you that Q intersects R3 and R4.
    But how do we automate searching in the tree?
    <li> The idea is to perform search similar to insertion.
    Start by checking whether Q intersects any data rectangle
    stored off of the root node. Then, compute which quadrants
    Q intersects with. Then recursively search each of these quadrants.
    <!--
    <li> See <a href="a2pseudo.html">Pseudocode</a>.
    -->
    </ul>
  <li> Finally, let's consider how a filter tree can be used for the
  two-set intersection problem. Recall that the input to this problem
  consists of two sets of rectangles. First, insert one set of data
  rectangles into a filter tree. Then, use each rectangle in the
  second set to query against the tree.
  <pre><font color="#000000">
  <b>Algorithm</b>: findIntersections (rectSet1, rectSet2)
  <b>Input</b>: two sets of rectangles containing n and m rectangles respectively
       <font color="#DC143C">// First, place data rectangles in rectSet1 into tree.</font>
  1.   makeFilterTree (rectSet1)
       <font color="#DC143C">// Now scan rectangles in second set and query against tree.</font>
  2    <b>for</b> i = 0 <b>to</b> m
         <font color="#DC143C">// Get list of intersections from tree.</font>
  3.     LinkedList intersectionSet = filterTreeSearch (rectSet2[i]);
  4.     <b>if</b> intersectionSet <b>not empty</b>
  5.       numIntersections += intersectionSet.size();
  6.       Place intersections in intersectionSet into list of intersections;
  7.     <b>endif</b>
  8.   <b>endfor</b>
  9.   <b>return</b> all intersections;
  </font></pre>
  </ul>

Implementation:
  <ul>
  <li> Name your algorithm <tt><font color="#000000">FilterTreeRectIntersection.java</font></tt>.
  <li> Your algorithm will need to implement the
  <a href="RectangleSetIntersectionAlgorithm.html"> 
 RectangleSetIntersectionAlgorithm</a> interface that itself extends the
  <a href="Algorithm.html">
  Algorithm</a> interface 
  you've already used. Also see the other javadocs referenced above.
  <li> Use instances of the class 
  <a href="FilterTreeNode.html">FilterTreeNode</a>
  for each tree node. Note that the constructor of this class
  computes the vertical and horizontal bisectors.
  <li> Note: you can identify the region size by scanning all data
  rectangles and recording the min and max of the X and Y values.
  <li> Suggested steps for implementation: 
    <ul>
    <Li> Start with some pen-and-paper work: write down detailed pseudocode for
    insertion and search in the filter tree, and for the two-set
    intersection that uses the tree.
    <b> Submit this pseudocode in Part I</b>.
    <li> You will find it useful to write code that decides whether
    two given rectangles intersect.
    Likewise, you will find it useful to write code to identify
    whether a given rectangle intersects with a node's bisectors.
    <li> First get your code working for just two rectangles in each
    rectangle set.
    </ul>
  <li> Implement a print-tree method. Use the 5-rectangle example 
  above to show that your code is working correctly. Submit hardcopy output
  from your print-tree with this example, and another example.
  <li> Compare the performance of the filter tree approach with the
  naive method. Do not spew out debugging into or print-tree output
  for this part. 
  <li> You may use <a href="a2.props2">this properties file</a> with
  the test environment.
  <li> Try filter trees of different depths, and adjust the 
  region and rectangle sizes to see when the filter tree performs well.
  <li> Submit your pseudocode as part of your Part II submission as well.
  </ul>

</ol>


<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Submission: </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<li> The written part of Part I is due (in my mailbox) one week before Part II. However, you would be
well-advised to get started with Part II early.
<li> For this assignment and others, you will need to follow
the usual <a href="../../submit/submit.html">submission instructions</a>
carefully.
<li> <b>Part I</b>:
For Part I, 
the name of subdirectory should be: your username
followed by <font color="#000000"><tt>_a2_1</tt></font>. 
<br>
Example: if your username is <font color="#000000"><tt>beavis</tt></font>
your subdirectory will be called 
<font color="#000000"><tt>beavis_a2_1</tt></font>.
<br> Thus, the jar file will be called 
<font color="#000000"><tt>beavis_a2_1.jar</tt></font>.

<li> <b>Part II</b>:
For Part II, 
the name of subdirectory should be: your username
